How does the internet work? The best way to transmit data is through a fiber optic network, which connects the datacenter and your device with a fiber optic cable. In the data center we can find a server, inside the server there is anSSD, all the information is stored on the SSD disk.

We get data to our devices using IP addresses, specific numbers of a particular device on the network. But people usedomains instead of IP addresses for easy recall.

There is DNS to store domains and IP addresses, if we know the domain, we can find IP addresses in it.
The distribution of IP addresses is handled by ICANN. Information is transmitted in packets, each packet taking up 6bits.
The whole Internet can be compared to a postal network.
There is another way - the use of satellites. But this is not the best way to transmit data, because due to the longdistance, there is a strong signal delay as the data compared to cables.

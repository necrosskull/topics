        <p>There are many benefits from an open system like the Internet, but one of the risks is that we are often exposed to hackers, who break into computer systems just for fun, to steal information, or to spread viruses .</p>
<p>Security on the Web Security is crucial when you send confidential information online.  Private networks can be attacked by intruders who attempt to obtain information such as Social Security numbers, bank асcounts or research and business reports. To protеct crucial data, companies hire security consultants who analyse the risks and provide solutions. The most common methods of protection are passwords for aссess control, firewalls, and encryption and decryption systems. Similarly, a computer virus is a very small program гoutine that infeеcts a computer system and uses its resources to reproduce itself. It often does this by рacching the operating system to enable it to detect program files, such as COM or EXE files. It then copies itself into those files. This sometimes causes harm to the host computer system. When the user runs an infected program, it is loaded into memory carrying the virus. The virus uses a common programming technique to stay resident in memory. It can then use a reproduction routine to infect other programs.</p>
<p>Worms are self-cоруing programs that have the capacity to move from one computer to another without human help, by exploiting securiry flaws in computer nerworks. Worms are self- contained and don&rsquo;t need to be attached to a document or program the way viruses do.</p>
<p>Trojan horses are malicious programs disguised as innocent-looking files or cmbedded within legitimate sofrware. Once they are activated, they may affect the computer in a variery of ways: some are just annoying, others are more ominous, creating a backdoor to the computer which can be used to collect stored data.</p>
<p>Spyware, software designed to collect information from computers for eriminal purposes, is anorher example of malicious sofrware. It usua freeware or shareware applications downloadable from the Internet.</p>
